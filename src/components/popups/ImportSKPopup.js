              You are about to import a Secret Key into this wallet.
              <br />
              You should only do this if you have{" "}
              <i>a file containing an exported Secret Key</i> from another
              device.
              <br />
              <br />
              Importing Secret Keys means that all NFTs, debris and Celelestium
              toknes will to be <i>tranferred one of the the two keys</i>. When
              importing Secret Keys you have two choices; transferring
              everything to the imported Secret Key and replacing the key in
              your wallet or transferring everything from the imported Secret
              Key, to the Secret Key already in your wallet.

              You shold choose this option if you want this device to be synced
              up with the device you exported the Secret Key from. If Celestium
              is spent and/or NFTs are bought from another device (with the same
              Secret Key) those changes will also appear here and vice versa. If
              any other device is using the existing key in this wallet, they
              will become empty as all value is transferred to the imported
              Secret Key.

              Key already in this wallet, meaning that all other wallets using
              the imported Secret Key will be emptied.

              Mining is an inheritly random process. It is theoritically
