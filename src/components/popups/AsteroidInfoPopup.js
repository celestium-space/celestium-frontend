              The database consists of 600,000 real near-earth asteroids.
              <br />
              <br />
              Asteroid data such as details on orbits, mass and composition is
              used to estimate the costs and rewards of mining asteroids.

              The associated AI generated image has been created from space
              radiation collected aboard the International Space Station.

              Composition data is based on spectral classification and size.

              <br />
              The calculations incorporate conclusions from multiple scientific
              publications in addition to cross-referencing known meteorite
              data.
              <br />
              <br />
              The data is based upon Asterank&apos;s database sourced from the
              Minor Planet Center and NASA JPL.
