# celestium-frontend

This is the react front-end for the Celestium project.

It's pixelflut backed by the celestium blockchain.
Once your pixelflut transactions have made it onto the blockchain,
you will be rewarded with some crypto-currency that you can use to buy NFTs,
which represent known asteroids in orbit of the sun.


## Development

### Change the Backend URL

As of yet, the URL of the back end is *hard-coded* in a javascript file somewhere.

Find it and change it (and remember to not commit it!),
or mess around with name resolution on your local machine so it works right.

*This should be fixed* - but I don't have any more time rn so ü§∑
